# Hash Maps and Sorting

This Java program demonstrates the usage of HashMap and TreeMap to store and sort state-capital pairs. It showcases automatic sorting with TreeMap and allows users to retrieve capitals using a Binary Search Tree (BST).

## Overview

The program:
- Stores state-capital pairs in a HashMap.
- Displays unsorted data from the HashMap.
- Automatically sorts data with TreeMap.
- Enables capital retrieval by entering state names through a BST.

## Functionality

- Populates and displays unsorted state-capital pairs.
- Sorts pairs alphabetically by state names.
- Allows users to input state names and retrieves corresponding capitals.
- Supports easy program termination.

## Technologies

- Java
- HashMap and TreeMap for data storage and sorting
- Binary Search Tree (BST) for efficient data retrieval

## Usage

1. Compile and run `StateHashMap.java`.
2. View unsorted state-capital pairs.
3. Observe sorted pairs.
4. Enter state names to retrieve capitals.
5. Terminate the program by entering 'q'.

## Files

- `StateHashMap.java`: Main program file.

## Acknowledgments

This program provides a concise example of using HashMap, TreeMap, and Binary Search Tree (BST) in Java to manage and sort data efficiently.
