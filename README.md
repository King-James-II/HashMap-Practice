# Hash Maps and Sorting

This Java program showcases the usage of HashMap and TreeMap to store and sort data within a map data structure. It demonstrates the automatic sorting capabilities of TreeMap and the customization options provided by using comparators. Additionally, it utilizes a Binary Search Tree to store and retrieve data from the sorted TreeMap.

## Overview

The program illustrates the storage and sorting of state names and capitals using HashMap and TreeMap, respectively. It begins by populating a HashMap with state-capital pairs and displays the contents of the HashMap to demonstrate unordered storage. Then, it constructs a TreeMap from the HashMap data, showcasing automatic sorting by keys. Finally, it populates a Binary Search Tree (BST) with data from the TreeMap and allows users to retrieve state capitals by entering state names.

## Functionality

- Populates a HashMap with state names and capitals.
- Displays the contents of the HashMap to show unordered storage.
- Constructs a TreeMap from the HashMap data for automatic sorting by keys.
- Populates a Binary Search Tree (BST) with data from the TreeMap.
- Allows users to enter state names and retrieves corresponding capitals from the BST.
- Provides an option to quit the program.

## Technologies Used

- Java programming language
- HashMap and TreeMap data structures
- Binary Search Tree (BST) for efficient data retrieval

## Usage

1. Compile and execute the `StateHashMap.java` file.
2. Review the displayed contents of the HashMap, TreeMap, and Binary Search Tree.
3. Enter a state name to retrieve its capital from the Binary Search Tree.
4. Repeat step 3 as desired or enter 'q' to quit the program.

## Included Files

- `StateHashMap.java`: Main Java file containing program logic.

## Acknowledgments

This program serves as a practical example of utilizing HashMap, TreeMap, and Binary Search Tree (BST) data structures in Java. It offers insights into storing and sorting data efficiently while providing users with a seamless experience for retrieving information based on keys.
